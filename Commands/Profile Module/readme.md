# Profile Module

This module combines the default Tags Module included in Dyno with the power of Custom Commands to create a simple profile system for users.

## Guide Markdown
We assume you are using the default command prefix, `?`.  
Commands with inputs are denoted as `?command [input]`.  
Commands with choice inputs are denoted as `?command [input1/input2]`

## Requirements
* The default tag system in Dyno needs to be enabled. Use ``?module tags`` to enable the tag system.  

## Commands
* ``?setinfo [information]`` - Sets the text displayed on your profile.  
* ``?profile [user]`` - Views a user's profile.
