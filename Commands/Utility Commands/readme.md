# Utility Commands
Useful commands for communication and general server improvement.

## Guide Markdown
We assume you are using the default command prefix, `?`.  

## Commands
* `?advdm` - Sends a dm to the speficied user and then announces a success message. 
* `?dashbaord` - Links to the server's dashbaord.
* `?link` - Creates an embed containing a link, along with a message.
* `?lookup` - Shows information about the specified user (Updated by TheSilentPro#9920).
* `?mention` - Mentions the user, shows their status and then says the message you provide. Useful for anonymous pings.
* `?owner` - Sends a message to the server owner via DMs.
* `?panel` - Links to a specific module on the dashboard. List of modules: `autoroles`, `customcommands`, `moderation`, `music`, `autoresponder`, `tags`, `actionlog`, `announcements`, `automessage` & `automod`.
* `?reddit` - Searches the provided subreddit and then outputs the result in an embedded message. 
* `?pindmods` - Pings the moderators with a message. Requires two roles: `Trusted` & `Moderator` and one channel: `#mod-pings`.
